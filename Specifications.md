## TODO:

### Target:
Making 2 pages linked. Available from web (called **index** and **slides**.)

#### **index** page
A form to fill, with some criterion to refuse form (ex: fields not filled)
* 2 fields min
* can extend the number of fields clicking on "add"
* can remove field clicking on "rm" (2 fields min)
* A button to accept form
* A check to verify if all fields are filled AND if all fields contains different entry
* When the form is OK, clicking on the button leads to change page to **page_1**

A **slide like** page containing an image, a text.
* The text contains one entry from the previous filled form (the entry is choose randomly)
